Here are the directions and data for Project #1.  Please take a look at it and we will discuss it in detail at our next meetup.

REMEMBER for both this project and homework - these are group assignments and you will be rating each other on contributions.  You must make a strong 
contribution.  Alternatively, if your peers rate you poorly your grade will suffer.

You have plenty of time as this assignment is due 6/18 and is straight forward if you have kept up with the HW.

DATA 624 Summer 2023, Project #1.docx.docx
Data Set for Class.xls
 

You will forecast only 2 variables per CATEGORY (S01, S02, etc are categories) - This is easy if you look at the Schema.xlsx spreadsheet I have provided 
below. 

S01 – Forecast  Var01, Var02

S02 – Forecast  Var02, Var03

S03 – Forecast  Var05, Var07

S04 – Forecast  Var01, Var02

S05 – Forecast  Var02, Var03

S06 – Forecast  Var05, Var07

To clear up any confusion (and make even easier for you), I am providing the attached schema - in tabs S01.... S06 you will see 999999999 where you should 
enter your forecast - use this template to turn it your work.
